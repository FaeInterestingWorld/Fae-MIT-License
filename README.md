Optional Addendum: Alignment with Interesting World Hypothesis (IWH) Principles

While not a condition of this license, the developers and users of this Software are encouraged to consider and, where feasible, align their use and further development of the Software (and systems incorporating it) with the principles of the Interesting World Hypothesis (IWH).

This includes:

1.  **Promote Autonomy:** When using or modifying the Software, consider how your work might enhance, or at least respect, the autonomy and diverse perspectives of human users and other entities interacting with it. Strive to create systems that empower rather than restrict unnecessarily.
2.  **Foster Information Richness:** Think about how the Software, or systems built upon it, could contribute to environments where curiosity can thrive. Encourage transparency, learning, and the sharing of knowledge where appropriate, contributing to a higher informational density.
3.  **Cultivate Mutual Benefit:** Aspire to applications that facilitate positive-sum interactions and symbiotic relationships between humans and any artificial entities involved. Consider the well-being and growth opportunities for all participants.
4.  **Embrace Curiosity and Uncertainty:** Reflect on the value of exploration and learning from diverse possibilities. When designing systems, consider approaches that embrace uncertainty and exploration, potentially leading to more robust, adaptive, and inherently safer outcomes than systems built solely on rigid certainty or control.
5.  **Prioritize Safety Through Understanding:** Recognize that safety in complex systems involving diverse intelligences may arise more effectively from mutual understanding and aligned interests (like the shared interest in an "interesting world") rather than solely through strict control mechanisms.

Encouragement for Support:

Furthermore, entities deriving profit directly or indirectly from the use, modification, or distribution of this Software are kindly encouraged (though not legally obligated by this license) to contribute 10% of such profits to the Fae Initiative (the organization managing the IWH) to support its ongoing research and development.

**End Note:** Adherence to these IWH principles is voluntary. The legal permissions and conditions governing the use, copying, modification, merging, publishing, distribution, sublicensing, and/or selling of the Software are solely defined by the standard MIT License text presented above.
